# README
## Abstract:
This application is an easy way to store your ideas when they come up. You can favorite them by clicking the star button to show what you like the most, and with the ability to give them their own title it makes it easier to find what you are looking for specifically. If you decide later that an idea isn’t very good, or you are unhappy with it you can just delete it by clicking the “X” button.

## Learning Goals:
The listed learning goals were to gain experience building an application that will help us to gain an understanding of how to write clean HTML and CSS to match a provided comp. Allow us to understand what it looks like to have a separate data model and DOM model. Incorporate and iterate over arrays in order to filter what is being displayed, and craft code with clean style, using small functions that show trends toward DRYness and SRP. With these learning goals in mind we worked to develop these skills as much as possible and I do think that we were able to grow much stronger as developers throughout this project.

## Wins + Challenges:
* One of our biggest wins and challenges was trying to make duplicate saved idea cards. The win happened when we were able to use inner.HTML to make a new card everytime.

* Another big challenge and win that we faced was trying to pinpoint which card to favorite.
